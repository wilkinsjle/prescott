# Some Resources

---

## Git
- Good [rules to follow](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) for Git commit messages
- An interactive [Git cheat sheet](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html) to level up your Git-Fu ðŸ¥‹

## React
- [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). React.js is a Javascript library for for building user interfaces. It's a recent-ish, popular framework for websites, kind of like the thing after Angular.js.
- Great [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), useful to follow for building your first React app. Find a React buddy or mentor to go through this!
- Fantastic [video resource on Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) by the creator himself. Redux is a common (but it's not the only) state management library for React apps.
- Here are the redux [docs](https://redux.js.org/) if you get stuck
- We can write most of our css code using [styled components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
- Building a [form](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) in your react app is easy but [redux form](https://redux-form.com/7.3.0/docs/gettingstarted.md/) is the way to go if you want to connect them to tour redux store
- State management with Redux can get pretty heavy sometimes, so another alternative to state management some teams have tried to use is [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx). Here are the [intro docs](https://mobx.js.org/intro/overview.html), and here is an [intro tutorial](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html)

## Scala
- Fantastic [Scala course](https://github.com/wjlow/intro-to-scala) to follow and learn the Scala fundamentals. It will teach you everything you need to get going. If you are doing it yourself, find a Scala mentor or buddy so you don't miss out on commentary! Even better, sign up for the training course.
- The [Scala docs](https://docs.scala-lang.org/) are a good place to read up on Scala. This [article/tutorial](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html) in particular might be helpful if you are from a Java background.
- The unofficial [textbook on Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala), often referred to as the 'Scala Red Book'. Ask around for a copy you can borrow. (Or just google for it ðŸ¤”)
- My best advice for learning new complex languages is to just get hands on as much as you can! So try build something simple from scratch and see how you go, or pair as much as you can while you drive.

## Design Patterns
- Great reference/cheatsheet [diagrams](http://www.mcdonaldland.info/files/designpatterns/designpatternscard.pdf) for the GoF (Gang of Four) design patterns and principles
- An article on Medium that is a good intro/refresher to some of the common [GRASP patterns](https://medium.com/@ReganKoopmans/understanding-the-grasp-design-patterns-2cab23c7226e)

## Testing
- Confused about testing? What to test? How to test? Watch this awesome [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M) from a Railsconf in 2013 that will motivate and shape your thinking testing.
- What's the difference between [mocks and stubs?](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)
- But wait, don't worry about the differences. Here's a perspective on why [we shouldn't use mocks nor stubs at all!](https://www.rea-group.com/blog/to-kill-a-mockingtest/)

## Artificial Intelligence
- A great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O01G3tSYpU) overview on AI and where the field is heading
- A [thought provoking experiment](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/holding-a-black-mirror-up-to-artificial-intelligence) from the Science Gallery and SocialNUI about the ethics of AI called the 'Biometric Mirror'
- I've heard good things about this course at [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)
- A great, lengthy [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/) on Neural Networks/Deep Learning (not free)
- My old lecturer's [lecture slides](https://github.com/trevorcohn/comp90051-2017/tree/gh-pages/slides) on statistical machine learning. (Warning, very scarily math intensive, but useful if you want to pick out one topic and try to understand how it works.)
